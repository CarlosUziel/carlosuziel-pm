# Introduction

Welcome! My name is Carlos and this is the first blog post of my personal website. It is only fitting that the first thing I write about is the website itself, the motivation behind it and a bit about the process of building it.

# Motivation

Since a while ago I have had this nagging feeling telling me that I needed my own unified platform to present myself, to share my work and to talk about it. In essence, a personal portfolio or website showcasing my career and me as a professional. There are already so many third-party platforms out there that one can use for that purpose, from LinkedIn to Medium to even GitHub. However, none of these offer enough flexibility to really create a personal brand. And I don't blame them, because it is just not their function. For that reason, I embarked in a journey to produce and deploy my own personal portfolio.

Let me start by emphasizing this: **I am not a web developer**. Therefore, this website is not a mean to improve any of my limited skills in web development. Nonetheless, I still decided to build my portfolio website from scratch (with shortcuts as we will see later) instead of using any of the many website builder services available.

And why go through all the trouble, you may ask? Well, I can think of two good reasons. **First of all**, I am an engineer by nature, I like to build stuff by myself. And **second**, since this is a personal and individual project, I want it to be exactly how I want. Being able to customize every single detail (especially the look and feel) of any site is just not possible with the aforementioned services. They might offer great customization options, but they will never be the same as coding the site directly.

# Process

### Learning basic web technologies

The first step was to re-learn basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. Though I had already studied these during by bachelor studies, it had already been a while and thus had forgotten most of it. Without much effort, I found a great YouTube channel with everything I needed to fulfill my learning goals. [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/videos) not only had course playlists for everything I needed, but also those same courses were masterfully made, making them both enjoyable and educational. More concretely, these were the courses I followed at the beginning:

- [HTML & CSS Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu-q2zYwEYs&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G)
- [Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9haFPT7J25Q9GRB_ZkFrQAc)

### A website generator framework

The next step was to find a framework that would make creating a website as simple as possible, while still giving me full control over the look and feel of it. After an initial search, I chose to start learning [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static-site generation web framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org/). Also, I didn't want to have to deal with complicated style files and CSS rules, so I opted for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead. Although I looked at many template website before I started one, there was one particular one that ticked the most boxes for me and ended up being my main inspiration. This was the webpage of [Zubair Aziz](https://www.zubairaziz.com), who had kindly open-sourced his website, making it [accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/zubairaziz/zubairaziz.com).

However, after some time working with Gatsby, I looked for other alternatives as there were some small things that didn't convince me. I was especially annoyed by how slow the development running process was, where changes made to the source code would sometimes not even appear in the live server until I restarted the process. More and more I stumbled upon this other framework, [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). At first, it didn't seem to be as well documented as Gatsby and it also lacked an official template page. However, the sole fact that the Reddit activity was much bigger for NextJS than for Gatsby (and subsequently the number of people posting their website was also bigger), I decided to give it a chance. In the end, even when considering my obvious lack of understanding of the underlying functionalities, I just felt more comfortable using NextJS. My main inspiration here, which I actually use as the base for my own website, was the site from [Michael Hall](https://www.michael-hall.me/), also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/mah51/michael-hall.me). Through this project I also discovered [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), an alternative to Tailwind CSS.

Here are the resources I used to start learning all of this (plus the official documentation):
